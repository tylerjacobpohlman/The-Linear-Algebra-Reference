# The Linear Algebra Reference: An Online Resource for Linear Algebra

## About This Project

### Introduction

*The Linear Algebra Reference* is written entirely by me, [Tyler Pohlman](https://github.com/tylerjacobpohlman). This project began as notes I took for my [Introduction to Linear Algebra class at Miami University](https://bulletin.miamioh.edu/search/?P=MTH%20222) using [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md/). Through the course of this class, I found the inherent linking capability of mark down files entordinarily powerful and useful - i.e., having immediate access to what each theorem, proof, and example is referencing makes studying a lot easier and intuative. I decided to publish and refine these notes since I believe the linking capability of markdown can act as a useful tool to you as well.

### Limitations

Again, this is written entirely by me, [Tyler Pohlman](https://github.com/tylerjacobpohlman). I am not an expert in the field nor due I have any prior experience writing scholary material. As such, keep your expectations reasonable. Information may be inconsistent, incomplete, or outright incorrect. As such, I implore anyone reading this to note use this project as a direct subsitute to a proper textbook. There are plently of free ~~and better~~ resources online for teaching yourself Linear Algebra - e.g., [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra), [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~linear/linear-guest.pdf), and [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/).

Please note that this project is under heavy development. As such, you may experience the following issues: missing/broken links,
