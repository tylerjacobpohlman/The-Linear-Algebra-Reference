## \#Definition Kernel

Let $T: V \rightarrow W$ be a linear transformation. The **kernel** of $T$, denoted $\ker (T)$, is the set of all vectors in $V$ that are mapped by $T$ to $\vec{0}$ in $W$. That is,
$$\ker (T) = \left{ \vec{v}\in V : T(\vec{v})=\vec{0} \right}$$

## \#Definition Image

Let $T: V \rightarrow W$ be a linear transformation. The **image** of $T$, denoted $im (T)$, is the set of all vectors in $W$ that are images of vectors in $V$ in $W$. That is,
$$im(T) = \left{ \vec{w}\in W : \vec{w}=T(\vec{v}) \text{ for some } \vec{v}\in V \right}$$
