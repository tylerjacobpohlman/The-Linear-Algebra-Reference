## \#Remark $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\mathbb{P}*{n}$, and $M*{m,n}$ and their Respective Operations

### $\mathbb{R}^n$

**Definition:**
$$
\\mathbb{R}^n = \left{ \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} : a_i \in \mathbb{R} \right}
$$

**Operations:**

* **Vector Addition:**
  $$
  \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 + b_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n + b_n \end{bmatrix}
  $$

* **Scalar Multiplication:**
  $$
  c \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c a_1 \\ \vdots \\ c a_n \end{bmatrix}
  $$

### $\mathbb{P}\_n$ (Polynomials of Degree $\leq n$)

**Definition:**
$$
\\mathbb{P}*n = { \text{polynomials of degree} \leq n }
$$
$$\mathbb{P}*{n} = \left{ a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n : a_0, \ldots, a_n \in \mathbb{R} \right}$$

**Operations:**

* **Vector Addition:**
  $$
  (a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n) + (b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_n x^n)
  $$
  $$= (a_0 + b_0) + (a_1 + b_1)x + \cdots + (a_n + b_n)x^n$$

* **Scalar Multiplication:**
  $$
  c(a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n) = (c a_0) + (c a_1)x + \cdots + (c a_n)x^n
  $$

### $M\_{m,n}$ (Matrices of Size $m \times n$)

**Definition:**
$$
M\_{m,n} = { (m \times n) \text{-matrices} }
$$

**Operations:**

* **Entrywise Addition:**
  If $A, B \in M\_{m,n}$, then $A + B$ is defined by adding corresponding entries of $A$ and $B$.

* **Scalar Multiplication:**
  If $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $A \in M\_{m,n}$, then $cA$ is defined by multiplying every entry of $A$ by $c$.

## \#Definition Vector Spaces and Vectors

Let $V$ be a set on which two operations, called *addition* and *scalar multiplication* have been defined. If $\vec{u},\vec{v}\in V$, then the *sum* of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ is denoted by $\vec{u}+\vec{v}$. If $c\in\mathbb{R}$, then the *scalar multiple* of $\vec{u}$ by $c$ is denoted by $c\vec{u}$. If the following properties hold for $\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}\in V$ and all $c,d\in\mathbb{R}$, then $V$ is called a **vector space** and its elements are called **vectors**.

1. $\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in V$ (Closure under addition)
1. $\vec{u}+\vec{v}=\vec{v}+\vec{u}$ (Commutativity)
1. $(\vec{u}+\vec{v})+\vec{w}=\vec{u}+(\vec{v}+\vec{w})$ (Associativity)
1. There exists an element $\vec{0}\in V$ such that $\vec{0}+\vec{v}=\vec{v}$ for all $\vec{v}\in V$
1. For each $\vec{v}\in V$, the exists an element $-\vec{v}\in V$ such that $-\vec{v}+\vec{v}=\vec{0}$
1. $c\vec{v}\in V$ for all $\vec{v}\in V$ (Closure under scalar multiplication)
1. $c(\vec{u}+\vec{v})=c\vec{u}+c\vec{v}$ (Distributivity)
1. $(c+d)\vec{u}=c\vec{u}+c\vec{v}$ (Distributivity)
1. $c(d\vec{u})=(cd)\vec{u}$
1. $1\vec{u}=\vec{u}$

## \#Remark $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a Vector Space

$\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector space since it follows the usual operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In other words, [Properties 1 and 6 of Vector Spaces and Vectors](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors) are satisfied for any vector $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ since, if 
$$
\\mathbb{R}^n = \left{ \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} : a_i \in \mathbb{R} \right},
$$ 
then 
$$
\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 + b_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n + b_n \end{bmatrix}
$$ 
and 
$$
c \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c a_1 \\ \vdots \\ c a_n \end{bmatrix}.
$$ 
Likewise, the remaining [Properties of Vector Spaces and Vectors](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors) are satisfied by [Algebraic Properties of Vectors](../Chapter%201%20Vectors/1.1%20The%20Geometry%20and%20Algebra%20of%20Vectors.md#theorem-algebraic-properties-of-vectors-in-mathbb-r-n) in $\mathbb{R}^n$, making it a **vector space**.

## \#Remark $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ is a Vector Space

Define $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ as the following:
$\mathbb{P}*{n} = \left{ a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n : a_0, \ldots, a_n \in \mathbb{R} \right}$
Let $p(x),q(x)\in\mathbb{P}^{n}$ where:
$$p(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n$$
$$q(x)=b*{0}+b\_{1}x+\cdots+b\_{n}x^{n}$$
and let $c,d\in\mathbb{R}$.
Following [Properties 1 Vector Spaces and Vectors](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors):
$$p(x)+q(x)= (a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n) + (b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_n x^n)$$
$$
p(x) + q(x) = (a_0 + b_0) + (a_1 + b_1)x + \cdots + (a_n + b_n)x^n 
$$
Since the polynomial goes up to degree $n$ and the scalars are still in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $p(x)+q(x)\in\mathbb{P}^{n}$.
Following [Properties 6 Vector Spaces and Vectors](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors):
$$
cp(x) = c(a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n) = (c a_0) + (c a_1)x + \cdots + (c a_n)x^n 
$$
Since the polynomial goes up to degree $n$ and the scalars are still in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $cp(x)\in\mathbb{P}^{n}$.
Likewise, the remaining [Properties of Vector Spaces and Vectors](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors) are satisfied similarly since:
2. $p(x)+q(x) = q(x)+p(x)$
3. $(p(x) + q(x)) + r(x) = p(x) + (q(x) + r(x))$
4. $p(x) + 0(x) = p(x)$
5.  $p(x) + (-p(x)) = 0(x)$
6. $cp(x)\in\mathbb{P}^{n}$.
7. $c(p(x) + q(x)) = cp(x) + cq(x)$
8. $(c + d)p(x) = cp(x) + dp(x)$
9. $c(dp(x)) = (cd)p(x)$
10. $1p(x) = p(x)$
Therefore, $\mathbb{P}\_n$ is a vector space.

## \#Remark The Union of All Polynomial Spaces is a Vector Space

Consider the sequence of polynomial spaces:
$$
\\mathbb{P}\_0 \subset \mathbb{P}\_1 \subset \mathbb{P}\_2 \subset \cdots
$$
where  $\mathbb{P}\_0$ is the space of constant polynomials (degree 0), $\mathbb{P}\_1$ is the space of polynomials of degree at most 1, $\mathbb{P}\_2$ is the space of polynomials of degree at most 2, etc.

The union of all these nested polynomial spaces forms the space of all polynomials:
$$
\\mathbb{P} = \bigcup\_{n=0}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}\_n = { \text{all polynomials} }
$$
This union $\mathbb{P}$, which includes polynomials of any degree, is also a vector space. It satisfies the vector space properties under the usual operations of polynomial addition and scalar multiplication, which are:

1. **Vector Addition**: For any $p(x), q(x) \in \mathbb{P}$, the sum $p(x) + q(x)$ is also in $\mathbb{P}$.
1. **Scalar Multiplication**: For any $c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $p(x) \in \mathbb{P}$, the product $cp(x)$ is also in $\mathbb{P}$.
   Therefore, the space of all polynomials $\mathbb{P}$ is a vector space because it inherits these properties from the individual spaces $\mathbb{P}\_n$.

## \#Remark $M\_{m,n}$ is a Vector Space

Any matrix $M\_{m,n}$ is a vector space since it follows the usual operations of addition and scalar multiplication. In other words, [Properties 1 and 6 of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors) are satisfied for any vector $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. 
If $M\_{m,n}$ represents all possible $m \times n$ matrices and the matrices $A, B \in M\_{m,n}$, then, per the [Definition of Matrix Addition](../Chapter%203%20Matrices/3.1%20Matrix%20Operations.md#definition-matrix-addition), $A+B$ is another $m \times n$ matrix - i.e., $A+B \in M\_{m,n}$. 
Also, per the [Definition of Scalar Multiplication](../Chapter%203%20Matrices/3.1%20Matrix%20Operations.md#definition-scalar-multiplication), $cA$ is another $m \times n$ matrix where all elements of $A$ are multiplied by the scalar $c$ - i.e., $cA \in M\_{m,n}$. 
The remaining [Properties of Vector Spaces and Vectors](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors) are satisfied by the [Algebraic Properties of Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication](../Chapter%203%20Matrices/3.2%20Matrix%20Algebra.md#theorem-algebraic-properties-of-matrix-addition-and-scalar-multiplication).

## \#Remark $\mathcal{F}$ is a Vector Space

Let $\mathcal{F} = { \text{all functions } f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} }$. In other words, let $\mathcal{F}$ denote the set of all real-valued functions defined on the real line.

If $f, g \in \mathcal{F}$, we can define $f + g$ by:
$$
(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
$$
which defines the *addition* operation.

And if $c \in \mathbb{R}$, define $cf$ by:
$$
(cf)(x) = cf(x)
$$
which defines the *scalar multiplication* operation.

Since the operations of *addition* and *scalar multiplication* are defined and the [Properties of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors) can be proven, then $\mathcal{F}$ is a vector space.

## \#Remark All Continuous Functions are Vector Spaces

Consider $\mathcal{C}^0(\mathcal{F}) = { \text{continuous functions } f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} }$.

Clearly,
$$
\\mathcal{C}^0(\mathcal{F}) \subseteq \mathcal{F}
$$

As such, $\mathcal{C}^0(\mathcal{F})$ is a vector space because the sum of two continuous functions is continuous and a scalar multiple of a continuous function is continuous.

## \#Remark All Differentiable Functions are Vector Spaces

Similarly, $\mathcal{D}'(\mathcal{F}) = { \text{differentiable functions } f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} }$ is also a vector space (under the same operations). 

Clearly,
$$
\\mathcal{D}'(\mathcal{F}) \subseteq \mathcal{C}^0(\mathcal{F}) \subseteq \mathcal{F}
$$

So, $\mathcal{D}'(\mathcal{F})$ is a vector space because the sum of two differentiable functions is differentiable and a scalar multiple of a differentiable function is differentiable.

## \#Example Examples of Vector Spaces

### Complex Numbers as Scalars

Let 
$$
\\mathbb{C}^n = \left{ \begin{bmatrix} z_1 \\ \vdots \\ z_n \end{bmatrix} : z_i \in \mathbb{C} \right}
$$
where $\mathbb{C}$ is the set of complex numbers. $\mathbb{C}^n$ is nearly analogous to $\mathbb{R}^n$, except that each element is a *complex number* instead of a *real number*.

If $\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in \mathbb{C}^n$, then the *addition* operation is defined as:
$$
\\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 + b_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n + b_n \end{bmatrix}
$$
and the *scalar multiplication* operation is defined as:
$$
c \vec{a} = c \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c a_1 \\ \vdots \\ c a_n \end{bmatrix}
$$
Clearly, these operations are feasible since the addition of two complex numbers is a complex number and multiplying a complex number by a real number is a complex number.

The remaining [Properties of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors) can be proven quite trivially too, so $\mathbb{C}^n$ is a vector space.

### Nonzero Real Numbers as Scalars

Let $V = \mathbb{R}^\* = { \text{nonzero reals} }$.

If $\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in V$, then the *addition* operation is defined as:
$$
a \oplus b = ab
$$
and the *scalar multiplication* operation is defined as:
$$
c \odot a = a^c
$$
Clearly, the *addition* operation is feasible since the product of two nonzero real numbers is a nonzero real number. If the addition operation was applied as normal, then there is the possibility that adding two nonzero real numbers would result in zero. Likewise, the *scalar multiplication* operation is feasible since a real number raised to the power of any real number is a real number. The deviation from the normal *scalar multiplication* operation is used in order to differentiate from the *addition* operation.
The remaining [Properties of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors) can be proven quite trivially too, so $V$ is a vector space.

## \#Example Non-Examples of Vector Spaces

### Function Space with Fixed Value

Let 
$$
\\mathcal{G} = { g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \mid g(0) = 1 }
$$ 
$\mathcal{G}$ is **not** a vector space since it doesn't satisfy [Properties 1 and 4 of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors). 

Following [Property 1 of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors), if $f, g \in \mathcal{G}$, then:
$$
f(x) + g(x) \notin \mathcal{G}
$$
since $(f + g)(0) \neq 1$.

Likewise, following [Property 4 of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors):
$$
0(x) \notin \mathcal{G}
$$
since $0(0) \neq 1$.

### Positive Real Coordinate Space

Let 
$$
\\mathbb{R}^n\_+ = \left{ \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{bmatrix} : a_1, \ldots, a_n \ge 0 \right}
$$ 

$\mathbb{R}^n\_+$ is not a vector space since it doesn't satisfy [Properties 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors). 

Following [Property 5 of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors), if $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n\_+$, then:
$$
-\vec{v} \notin \mathbb{R}^n\_+
$$
since all the elements of $-\vec{v}$ are negative, which contradicts the definition of $\mathbb{R}^n\_+$.

Likewise, following [Properties 6, 7, 8, and 9 of Vector Spaces](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-vector-spaces-and-vectors), if $c \in \mathbb{R}*{-}$, then:
$$
c \vec{v} \notin \mathbb{R}^n*+
$$
since all the elements of $c \vec{v}$ are negative, which also contradicts the definition of $\mathbb{R}^n\_+$.

# Subspaces

## \#Definition Subspace

A **subspace** of a vector space $V$ is a subset $W \subseteq V$ that is itself a vector space with the same *addition* and *scalar multiplication* operations as defined on $V$.

## \#Theorem Subspace Characterization Theorem

Let $V$ be a vector space and let $W$ be a nonempty subset of $V$. Then $W$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if the following conditions hold:

1. $\vec{0} \in W$
1. If $\vec{u}, \vec{v}\in W$, then $\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in W$
1. If $\vec{v}\in W$ and $c\in\mathbb{R}$, then $c\vec{v}\in W$

## \#Example Examples of Subspaces

### $\mathbb{P}\_n$ is a Subspace of $\mathbb{P}\_n+1$

For any $n \ge 0$, 
$$
\\mathbb{P}*n \text{ is a subspace of } \mathbb{P}*{n+1}.
$$
Furthermore,
$$
\\mathbb{P}\_0 \subset \mathbb{P}\_1 \subset \mathbb{P}*2 \subset \cdots \subset P*{n-1}
$$
As such, all $\mathbb{P}\_n$ are subspaces of $\mathbb{P}$.

### The Set of Differentiable Functions is a Subset of the Set Continuous Functions, which is a Subset of the Set of All Functions

$$
\\mathcal{D}^{'} \subset \mathcal{C}^0 \subset \mathcal{F}
$$
In fact, $\mathcal{D}^{'}$ is a subspace of $\mathcal{C}^0$ and $\mathcal{C}^0$ is a subspace of $\mathcal{F}$.

### Show that $W$ is a subspace of $M\_{n,n}$.

Let $W = { A \in M\_{n,n} \mid A \text{ is symmetric} }$. In other words, for all $A\in W$, $A=A^{T}$.
Show that $W$ is a subspace of $M\_{n,n}$.
Following the [Subspace Characterization Theorem](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#theorem-subspace-characterization-theorem):

1. The zero matrix $0 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is in $W$ since $0=0^{T}$.

1. Suppose $A, B \in W$. This means $A^T = A$ and $B^T = B$. As such, $(A + B)^T = A^T + B^T = A + B$

1. Suppose $A \in W$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$. This means $A^T = A$. As such, $(cA)^T = cA^T = cA$.
   Give all 3 conditions are met, then $W$ is a subspace of $M\_{nn}$.

#### Show that $\mathcal{S}$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{F}^2$.

Consider the set $\mathcal{S}$ of all solutions to the differential equation
$$
y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0.
$$
Let $y = y(x)$.
Following the [Subspace Characterization Theorem](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#theorem-subspace-characterization-theorem):

1. The zero function $z(x) =0$ for all $x$ is a solution of the differential equation.

1. Now suppose $y_1, y_2 \in \mathcal{S}$. This means:
   $$
   y_1'' + 3y_1' + 2y_1 = 0
   $$
   and
   $$
   y_2'' + 3y_2' + 2y_2 = 0.
   $$
   Then
   $$
   (y_1 + y_2)'' + 3(y_1 + y_2)' + 2(y_1 + y_2) = y_1'' + y_2'' + 3(y_1' + y_2') + 2(y_1 + y_2) = (y_1'' + 3y_1' + 2y_1) + (y_2'' + 3y_2' + 2y_2) = 0 + 0 = 0.
   $$
   Thus, $y_1 + y_2 \in \mathcal{S}$.

1. Similarly, $\mathcal{S}$is closed under scalar multiplication.

### The set $U_n$ of upper triangular $(n \times n)$ matrices is a subspace of $M\_{n,n}$.

# Spanning Sets

## \#Definition Spanning

Let $V$ be a vector space with the vectors $\vec{v}*{1}, \dots, \vec{v}*{k} \in V$. The subset ${ \vec{v}*{1}, \dots, \vec{v}*{k} }$ **spans** $V$ if and only if every vector $\vec{v} \in V$ is a [linear combination](6.1%20Vector%20Spaces%20and%20Subspaces.md#definition-linear-combination) of $\vec{v}*{1}, \dots, \vec{v}*{k}$. That is, every vector $\vec{v} \in V$ can be written as $\vec{v} = c\_{1}\vec{v}*{1} + \dots + c*{k}\vec{v}*{k}$ where $c*{1}, \dots, $c\_{k} \in \mathbb{R}$.
